## Contributing

For this project a workflow known as [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html) is used

### What does that mean?
* Anything in the `master` branch is deployable. Meaning everything in `master`should be stable and working. 
* If you want to work on something new, *create a descriptively* named branch off of `master` (ie: `footer-widget`)
* Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
* When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a *pull request*
  * Pull requests should have some form of indication to progress (*ie: checkboxes showing what is left to do and what is done*)
* When your feature is ready for merging, indicate this in your pull request and it will be looked at and if it's all okay it will be merged

**If anything seems unclear or you have a question about this project. Feel free to contact [@reedyn](https://github.com/reedyn) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/Jonkopingspiraterna/Ahoy/issues/new) with the question.**
