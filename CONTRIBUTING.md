These are the contributing guidelines as well as some documentation on how the code is structured. Read up before contributing to make everything as smooth as possible.

## Posting issues
Just common sense; do a quick search before posting (click the top search bar or hit `s` and type `type:issues` followed by your keywords), someone might already have created an issue (or resolved the problem!). If you're posting a bug; try to include as much relevant information as possible.

## Workflow

We are using a workflow known as [GitHub Flow](http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html).

### What does that mean?
* Anything in the `master` branch is deployable. Meaning everything should be tested and tried before merging into `master`.
* If you want to work on something new, *create a descriptively* named branch off of `master` (ie: `footer-widget`).
* Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server
* When you need state that you've started working on a feature, if you want feedback, help or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a *pull request*
  * Pull requests should have some form of indication to progress (*ie: checkboxes showing what is left to do and what is done*)
  * You can do checkboxes using `* [x] Checked`
* When your feature is ready for merging, indicate this in your pull request and it will be looked at and if it's all okay it will be merged

**If anything seems unclear or you have a question about this project. Feel free to contact [@reedyn](https://github.com/reedyn) or [open a new issue](https://github.com/Jonkopingspiraterna/Ahoy/issues/new) with the question.**
