<h3>
<a name="posting-issues" class="anchor" href="#posting-issues"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Posting issues</h3>

<p>Just common sense; do a quick search before posting (click the top search bar or hit <code>s</code> and type <code>type:issues</code> followed by your keywords), someone might already have created an issue (or resolved the problem!). If you're posting a bug; try to include as much relevant information as possible.</p>

<a name="workflow" class="anchor" href="#workflow"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow</h3>

<p>We are using a workflow known as <a href="http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html">GitHub Flow</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Anything in the <code>master</code> branch is deployable. Meaning everything should be tested and tried before merging into <code>master</code>.</li>
<li>If you want to work on something new, <em>create a descriptively</em> named branch off of <code>master</code> (ie: <code>footer-widget</code>).</li>
<li>Commit to that branch locally and regularly push your work to the same named branch on the server</li>
<li>When you need state that you've started working on a feature, if you want feedback, help or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a <em>pull request</em>

<ul>
<li>Pull requests should have some form of indication to progress (<em>ie: checkboxes showing what is left to do and what is done</em>)</li>
<li>You can do checkboxes using <code>* [x] Checked</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When your feature is ready for merging, indicate this in your pull request and it will be looked at and if it's all okay it will be merged</li>
</ul><p><strong>If anything seems unclear or you have a question about this project. Feel free to contact <a href="https://github.com/reedyn">@reedyn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Jonkopingspiraterna/Ahoy/issues/new">open a new issue</a> with the question.</strong></p>
